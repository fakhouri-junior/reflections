How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
it helps a lot to use this awesome tool because it gets rid of everything similar and only shows
what differs and that makes it a lot easier to pinpoint the differences and see the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
it would definitely help me because it will allow me to easily implement new features and test them without worrying
about the old code, as in any moment I can just as easily go back and get my old code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved,
like Google Docs does?
manual commit is much more flexible and give freedom to the programmer, however, sometimes you forgot to commit
and you are in trouble.
