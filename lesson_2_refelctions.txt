What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git initiates an empty one for you.
We need to do it to start a new repository for our files or project, and it is
important for obvious reasons

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
the staging area is an extra layer of flexibility added to give the user more freedom by choosing
which files to commit and which to leave out

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
by always checking using git diff --staged what files are in there

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
branches are useful when you want to make changes to the code but you are not sure about them if
they will work out just fine or not, so this way you can protect your working code and experiment however
you like.
